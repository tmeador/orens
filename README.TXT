Oren, to tie JIRA with SVN commits, put the JIRA ID within the SVN commit when checking in.

For example you can put:

API-1 - I created this demo file as an example for Oren - wpool

Write it and then wait within the hour it'll be added to the JIRA database. You can see code changes there and reference the issue withn the ticketing system.
